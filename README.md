## card-game-project
**Big Picture:**
My project is a video game. It will be a game about cards. In this game, there are 2 players. The goal of this game is to kill the opponent.There are different kinds of cards with different functions. There could be different character with different skills. I can even make the winner earn some money in the game. The winner can use it to buy new characters.

**Plan:**

Create a deck with different cards that perform different thing. We need to make sure that the cards are random. Some cards should be more common than the other cards. For this game, each player gains 2 cards from the deck after each term. The deck will never run out of cards because this game never ends until one of the player dies.

Make the game work by creating the system of terms. Each player needs to gain 2 cards from the deck before they use any cards. The player will move after his opponent finished and gained his 2 new cards.

**Now we need to define card’s functions. I have designed 5 cards.**

-For the “attack” card, it can make the opponent lose 1 health if the opponent does not have a “block” card.

-The “block” card can help you avoid losing 1 health. 

-The “heart” card makes you gain 1 health. 

-The “alien invasion” card forces your opponent to use a “attack” card that is not toward you. If your opponent doesn't use an “attack” card, he will lose 1 health point. 

-The “peace” card makes you and your opponent both gain 1 health point. If you reach 3 health points, you can't add more health.

-Every player can keep block cards,peace cards and attack cards if they decide not to use the cards.
The end of the game is when one of the player’s health goes to 0.

**Problems**

I can’t check if the players have the block cards because my deck is a random function that keeps going on. I am unable to monitor the situation as it is happening.  
 
**Testing**

I will end up with 2 decks. One is for player 1 and the other one is for player 2. I also need to check the five different cards to see if they work. The “attack” cards can make opponent lose 1 health if the opponent does not have a “block” card. The “block” card can help you avoid losing 1 health from the attack card. The “heart” card makes you gain 1 health. The “alien invasion” card force your opponent to use a “attack” card that is not toward you. If your opponent doesn't have a “attack” card, he will lose 1 health point. The “peace” card makes you and your opponent both recover 1 health point.
